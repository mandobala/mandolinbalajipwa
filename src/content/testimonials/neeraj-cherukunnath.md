  I have been taking Carnatic Mandolin lessons from Balaji for the past few months. I am very pleased with Balaji’s way of teaching. I am amazed with the talent and fluency that Balaji has with Mandolin. He efficiently puts this to use during the lessons. The most helpful thing I noticed in his teaching is that he has tailored the lessons perfectly to suit my requirements
