  Having previously tried to teach myself Carnatic music without much success, I have found Balaji’s lessons to be invaluable. Exercises and Songs are taught in a way that I can follow without too much difficulty.

<!-- I have been taking Carnatic Mandolin lessons from Balaji for the past few months. I am very pleased with Balaji’s way of teaching. I am amazed with the talent and fluency that Balaji has with Mandolin. He efficiently puts this to use during the lessons. The most helpful thing I noticed in his teaching is that he has tailored the lessons perfectly to suit my requirements -->
