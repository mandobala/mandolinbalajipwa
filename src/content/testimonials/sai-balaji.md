  I had learnt Violin in my Childhood and had stopped due to personal reasons. 
  I still had the desire to learn and after the age of 50 one fine morning decided to learn Carnatic Mandolin. 
  With great difficulty I browsed the Internet & finally got the details of Sri. Balaji Rajamani who is the prime Student of the Mandolin Maestero Sri. U. Srinivasji

  He was kind enough to accept me as a student though I had already crossed 50

  Sri. Balaji Rajamani is a very patient Guru and he had first removed the fear in me to play. 

  He also has the knack of simplifying the songs by breaking them into multiple phrases just as a mother would feed a baby spoon by spoon. When you master each phrase and play them together you won’t be able to believe that it is you who is playing. One more great attribute is his positive talks. .. he would always be encouraging and never let your courage go down. My classes are on all Sundays and I can’t put in words to describe my joy in spending the time with him.

  I wish could have met him at-least a decade or 2 back…. Can anyone let me know where to get a time machine?
