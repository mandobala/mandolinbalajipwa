# Server Lyrics Folder

Place your LRC files here. The filename should match the audio filename (without extension).

Example:
- Audio file: `song.mp3`
- Lyrics file: `song.lrc`

The system will automatically detect if a server version is available and show a download button if it's newer than the locally loaded lyrics.
